# How to import a postman collection

## About Postman

Postman is a tool widely used by developers to work with APIs in a faster and easier way. Postman is an app available to download for windows and mac users.

A postman collection is a format used to describe APIs. It includes the organization of the APIs \(if they are in folders\), the API definition, parameters used to build the request, response and examples \(if added\). It can also include tests and documentation. This collection can be exported/imported from postman as a JSON file.
